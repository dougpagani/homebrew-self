- brew-formulae
  - ag assert -- see what kind of asserts they use
  - vimp z* just see some formulae for ideas
- brew install --build-from-source ./some-local-path
- brew --repo user/TAP -- how you get the directory of your personal tap

- variables can be def/EOS, or just a normal =-assignment expression
- brew-kegs to get to the .../Cellar
- brew-go for a nice hello-world -- obviously, it could be made to work

- To update a version:
  - make the change
  - tag the source/push the tag
  - grab the url for the new tag
  - run brew bump-formula-pr FORMULA and it will be updated with the new url
  - TEST:
    - brew install -vsd --git FORMULA 
      - verbose, grab sources, debug on build-breakage by entering into the dir, and make it git-changeable

  * good tips for all this:
https://jonathanchang.org/blog/updating-homebrew-formulae-when-your-software-gets-a-new-version/
- brew-install-dev is a good installer for developing of formulae

- can build from a file directly (inside of a tap-project):
brew install --build-from-source ./foo.rb
